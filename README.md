[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) 

# Pre-reqs
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
```
cd year-of-code
npm install
```
- Start your mongoDB server (you'll probably want another command prompt)
```
mongod
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm run start
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Runs full build before starting all watch tasks. Can be invoked with `npm start`                  |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `tslint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                               |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `build-sass`              | Compiles all `.scss` files to `.css` files                                                        |
| `watch-sass`              | Same as `build-sass` but continuously watches `.scss` files and re-compiles when needed             |
| `tslint`                  | Runs TSLint on project files                                                                      |
| `copy-static-assets`      | Calls script that copies JS libs, fonts, and images to dist directory                             |
